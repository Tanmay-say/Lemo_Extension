 * @title PaymentProcessor
 * @notice Processes PYUSD (and other ERC-20) payments and automatically records receipts on LighthouseReceipt
 * @dev This contract facilitates payments to a merchant wallet and integrates with the LighthouseReceipt contract.
 *      IMPORTANT: Users must approve this contract to spend their PYUSD before calling processPayment.
 *      
 *      Payment Flow:
 *      1. Extension uploads receipt JSON to Lighthouse/IPFS (gets CID)
 *      2. User approves PaymentProcessor to spend PYUSD tokens
 *      3. User calls processPayment() which:
 *         - Transfers PYUSD from user to merchant wallet
 *         - Records receipt on LighthouseReceipt contract
 *         - Emits PaymentProcessed event
 *      
 *      Security: All payments go directly to merchant wallet (no escrow in contract).
 *      SECURITY FIX: emergencyWithdraw now uses transfer() instead of transferFrom()
